<P align="left"><SPAN class="heading">Introduction<BR>
</SPAN>The <B>BadSoft Mass Renamer</B> was originally created because, as a computer user, I knew that there comes a time in everybody's life where they have to rename a large group of files. I looked around, and found a few programs that did the job. But they were either too difficult to use (Directory Opus), too weak (some VB project I found a while ago), or just plain expensive (Adobe Photoshop).<BR>
This program has been created around Adobe Photoshop 7's excellent batch renaming system, which allows you to include various fields in the new file names.</P>
<P align="left"><SPAN class="heading">How to use</SPAN><BR>
Simply run the program from Explorer, and you should eventually see the following screen:</P>
<P align="left">
<IMG src="images/shot_massrenamer.gif" alt="" width="641" height="398"></P>
<P align="left">By selecting a folder in the left-hand pane, a list of all files within that folder will be displayed on the right. You can click on the column headers to sort by criteria.</P>
<P align="left">Only files with a tick mark next to them will be included in the list of files to rename. To tick single items, click in the black box next to the name. You can also use the toolbar underneath to <B>select all files</B>, <B>invert the selection</B> or <B>deselect all files</B> respectively.</P>
<P align="left">The <B>Renaming format</B> group allows you to choose the format for the new filenames. In each of the boxes you can either type in literal text, select a field (curly brackets), or leave it blank.</P>
<P align="left">To see the effects of your field selection, make sure the <B>Test mode </B>checkbox is ticked. When you press the Rename file(s) button,  you will see a list of the selected files, along with the new names. No changes are made while the <B>Test mode</B> checkbox is checked.</P>
<P align="left">When using serial fields, you can choose which number they start from by changing the box marked <B>Serial number starts at</B>. The order the files are listed in the right-hand pane are the order the files are given serial values.</P>
<P align="left">The current date (ie. today's date) is used when using date fields.</P>

I am happy to answer any questions, <B>thought-out </B>comments and suggestions you might have. If you find any bugs in this program, please let me know and I will get to the bottom of it.</P>
<P align="left"><SPAN class="heading">Shouts and special thanks</SPAN><BR>
A big thank you goes out to the <A href="http://mvps.org/ccrp" target="_blank">Common Controls Replacement Project</A>, without which I would not have an Explorer-style tree that makes life much easier. Another big thank you goes out to <A href="http://vbaccelerator.com" target="_blank">VB Accelerator</A> for their almost straightforward, ActiveX-less splitter.<BR>
Most importantly, a shout goes out to everybody who brought positive vibes to <B>BadSoft Online</B> - without whom I would be as useful as a boiled egg. I promise there will be more things on the way.</P>
